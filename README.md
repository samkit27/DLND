# DLND : Deep learning Nanodegree Udacity

## [Project 1 : Bike Sharing Prediction](https://github.com/samkit27/DLND/tree/master/Project%201%20Bike%20Sharing%20Prediction)

# Overview  :
Build Neural Network from Scratch


## [Project 2 : Dog Breed Classification](https://github.com/samkit27/DLND/tree/master/dog_project)

# Overview :
Learn Basic fundamental of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning
# Our approach :
Detect Dogs via Pretrained VGGNet and Detect human faces with Haarcascade 
Make Dataloader according to train and test augmentation with PyTorch Transforms
Used Pretrained Resnet101 for transfer learning
Used Adam as optimizer 
Results : 84% accurate on testing set
