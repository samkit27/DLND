# DLND : Deep learning Nanodegree Udacity

## [Project 1 : Bike Sharing Prediction](https://github.com/samkit27/DLND/tree/master/Project%201%20Bike%20Sharing%20Prediction)

#### Overview  :
Build Neural Network from Scratch


## [Project 2 : Dog Breed Classification](https://github.com/samkit27/DLND/tree/master/dog_project)

### Overview :
Learn Basic fundamental of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning
#### Proposed approach :
1. Detect Dogs via Pretrained VGGNet and Detect human faces with Haarcascade 
2. Make Dataloader according to train and test augmentation with PyTorch Transforms
3. Used Pretrained Resnet101 for transfer learning
4. Used Adam as optimizer
5. Results : 84% accurate on testing set
